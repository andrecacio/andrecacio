# Hi there, I'm Andrea Cacio 👋

## Software & Backend Engineer

I am a Software Engineer specializing in backend development, cloud architectures, and robust API design. With a strong academic foundation from **Politecnico di Torino** (BSc & MSc in Computer Engineering), I bridge the gap between low-level system efficiency and high-level software architecture. I focus on writing clean, testable code and building scalable infrastructures.

### 🚀 What I do
**Backend Development:** Designing secure, scalable RESTful APIs using **Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, and Python**.
**Database Management:** Relational database design, complex queries, and ORM integration (SQL, TypeORM)
**DevOps & CI/CD:** Containerizing applications with **Docker** and managing deployment pipelines.
**System Engineering:** Strong understanding of Linux/Unix environments, POSIX libraries, and low-level programming (C, Rust, C++).

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
**Languages:** JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, C/C++, Rust, SQL 
**Frameworks & Web:** Express.js, React, HTML/CSS 
**Tools & Infrastructure:** Git, Docker, Postman, Linux 

### 🤝 Let's work together
I am currently available for freelance projects. I can help you with:
* Building and debugging RESTful APIs.
* Writing automated tests for your backend.
* Dockerizing your existing Node.js applications.
