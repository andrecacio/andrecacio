# Hi there, I'm Andrea Cacio 👋

## Software & Backend Engineer

I am a Software Engineer specializing in backend development, cloud architectures, and robust API design. [cite_start]With a strong academic foundation from **Politecnico di Torino** (BSc & MSc in Computer Engineering) [cite: 6, 19][cite_start], I bridge the gap between low-level system efficiency and high-level software architecture. I focus on writing clean, testable code and building scalable infrastructures.

### 🚀 What I do
* [cite_start]**Backend Development:** Designing secure, scalable RESTful APIs using **Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, and Python**[cite: 26, 34].
* [cite_start]**Database Management:** Relational database design, complex queries, and ORM integration (SQL, TypeORM)[cite: 35, 52].
* [cite_start]**DevOps & CI/CD:** Containerizing applications with **Docker** and managing deployment pipelines[cite: 37, 53].
* [cite_start]**System Engineering:** Strong understanding of Linux/Unix environments, POSIX libraries, and low-level programming (C, Rust, C++)[cite: 24, 25, 27, 38].

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* [cite_start]**Languages:** JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, C/C++, Rust, SQL [cite: 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 35]
* [cite_start]**Frameworks & Web:** Express.js, React, HTML/CSS [cite: 33, 34]
* [cite_start]**Tools & Infrastructure:** Git, Docker, Postman, Linux [cite: 37, 38]

### 💻 Featured Projects
* **[GeoControl]** - *IoT Backend API*
    Developed the backend infrastructure for a simulated IoT sensor and gateway monitoring system. [cite_start]Implemented an MVC architecture, automated testing suites, and Docker containerization[cite: 51, 52, 53].
* **[Stuff Happens]** - *Full-Stack Web Application*
    Built a complete interactive web application featuring a React frontend and an Express.js/SQL backend, managing complex game state and data persistence[cite: 59, 60].

### 🤝 Let's work together
I am currently available for freelance projects. I can help you with:
* Building and debugging RESTful APIs.
* Writing automated tests for your backend.
* Dockerizing your existing Node.js applications.
